This example demonstrates a common JavaScript error caused by type coercion.  The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's loose typing, when a number and a string are added with the `+` operator, the number is coerced into a string, resulting in string concatenation rather than numerical addition.  The solution involves explicit type checking or conversion to ensure numerical operations are performed correctly.
